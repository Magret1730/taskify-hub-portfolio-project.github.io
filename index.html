        <!-- <p class="lead mb-0">Hi there! I'm Oyedele Abiodun Magret, a passionate software developer with a background in ALX Africa Software Development. My
          journey in software development began with my enrollment in the ALX Africa Software Development program, where I
          gained a solid foundation in full-stack web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and more. Throughout
          the foundation program, I worked on various projects, honing my skills in problem-solving, collaboration, and project management.
          This project you see here is the culmination of my efforts during the foundation program of ALX Africa program. It represents my
          technical skills and passion for building meaningful solutions. As my foundation project, it
          showcases my ability to create user-friendly and efficient tools for productivity. With my foundation project
          completed, I am excited to continue my journey in the specialization program as a software developer. I also seek opportunities to contribute to
          innovative projects and make a positive impact in the tech community. Whether it's building cutting-edge applications,
          collaborating with talented teams, or exploring new technologies, I am committed to continuous learning and growth in
          this dynamic field. Thank you for visiting my foundation portfolio and exploring my work. Feel free to reach out if you have any
          questions or would like to connect!

        <p class="lead mb-0">Taskify Hub is more than just a project, it is a journey inspired by personal experiences and
          aspirations. As a dedicated mother, wife, and tech enthusiast, I intimately understand the challenges of managing multiple roles and
          responsibilities. Fueled by my passion for technology and driven by the desire to simplify the chaos of everyday life, I
          embarked on the journey to develop Taskify Hub - a tool designed to streamline task management and enhance
          productivity. Crafted as a Portfolio Project for ALX Africa Software Development program, Taskify Hub represents the culmination of my skills
          and experiences gained throughout my educational journey. It's a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and
          growth in the field of software development. This project was also developed within the space of three weeks.
          Although I worked alone on this project, Taskify Hub embodies the spirit of collaboration. It's the
          result of countless hours of dedication, learning, and problem-solving, driven by my determination to create something
          meaningful and impactful.
